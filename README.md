# Clustering-Champo
Improving B2B Sales using Machine Learning (Clustering)

Champo Carpets, a traditional manufacturer, sent sample designs to clients based on demand, a costly and intricate process. Samples were selected considering past purchases, raw material availability, and preferences for upselling.A proposal was made using carpet attributes to segment customers for preference models. We aim to boost conversions by offering tailored samples. Analysis was performed by identifying key customers and products, linking them via data attributes and analytics models. This approach would enable Champo Carpets to recommend optimal sample sets, boosting conversion rates efficiently.
